## Migration from Microsoft Authenticators

If you are currently using Microsoft Authenticator for your TOTP codes, you can easily migrate your TOTP data to the Casdoor Authenticator App. To do this, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Export TOTP data from Microsoft Authenticator

The Microsoft Authenticator app does not provide an export feature. If you want to export your TOTP data, you can use the following steps to export the SQLite database and then import it to the Casdoor Authenticator App.

1. Export the SQLite database (required root access)

   - The database is located at `/data/data/com.azure.authenticator/databases/PhoneFactor`.
   - Copy the database file to your device's storage.

2. Import the SQLite database to the Casdoor Authenticator App

   - Open the Casdoor Authenticator App.
   - Click the "+" button to add a new account.
   - Select "Import from other app" and then select Microsoft Authenticator.
   - There will be a pop-up file picker. Select the database file you exported in Step 1.
   - The app will automatically add the accounts to your Casdoor Authenticator App, allowing you to manage your TOTP codes securely.
